note right of libs
  Third-party libraries and framework compose distinct subsystems
  which may follow Clean Architecture and expose their functionalities
  to be used by the adapter layer or require specific interfaces (just
  like our use cases layer which requires repo interfaces) in order to
  indirectly use components from our subsystem. So it is technically a
  parallel to the use cases layer from another subsystem, not above the
  adapter layer (and its code may be maintained by independent teams).
end note

adapter -> uc : adapters adapt the\nbusiness-level implementation of use cases layer\nto the technology-dependent implementation\nof 3rd-party libraries
uc -> model : use cases layer\ndepends on the models for\nits core business domain data types\nreceiving and operating on\nexisting instances or\ncreating them in response to\nincoming requests
adapter ----> model : adapters may use entity models\nas input/output for\nthe use cases layer
car_rs -up-> gin : adapters employ 3rd-party libraries for\ninteraction with other systems\nlike handling of web requests
car_rs -down-> car_uc : adapters depend on\nuse cases layer for\nactual handling of requests\nafter converting req/resp to/from\ntheir expected interfaces
car_orm -up-> db : adapters realize DB interactions\nusing libraries
car_orm ...> car_repo : <<realizes>>\nadapter layer implementation\nof DB operations\nis exposed in terms of\nuse cases layer repo interfaces\nto be used indirectly
